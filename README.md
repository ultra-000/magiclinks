# Magiclinks

## Brief and important information

Use Magiclinks to replace static links in your project with dynamic ones.
this is especially useful when the resources' locations used in you project (e.g. an image) are **subject to change**.

the concept is similar if not identical to the concept of [magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)) or read [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47882/what-are-magic-numbers-and-why-do-some-consider-them-bad) if you don't prefer wikipedia's style.

if you were afraid of changing some resource's location and breaking every file in your project that is depending on that resource then this library will be very helpful for you.

**üí° Note:** I am developing this on Linux and I am not testing this on Windows or Mac, **so compatibility will potentially be like trash**, if you encountered any problems please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ultra-000/magiclinks/issues)

## Installation: 

```sh
npm install --save-dev magiclinks
```

## Usage: 
```sh
npx magiclinks
```
if you want you could specify an on-the-fly configuration file or output directory using:
```sh
npx magiclinks -c <path-to-config-file> -o <path-to-output-directory>
```
or 
```sh
npx magiclinks --config <path-to-config-file> --output <path-to-output-directory>
```

**IMPORTANT: you should run these commands at your project's root ‚ö†Ô∏è**

### The configuration file

The configuration file contains the links mappings and other options that Magiclinks will use to operate.

**it should be placed at the project root and be named magiclinks.config.js if your not using `-c` or `--config` option to specify a custom location ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Here is a sample configuration file:**
```js
// magiclinks.config.js

export default {
  links: { // Define your links mappings here.
    $_github: "https://github.com"
    $_some_resource_with_a_variable_location: "assets/images/apple-touch-icon.png"
  },
  src_dirs: ["src/components", "views", "public"], // An empty array means: read the whole project except for the `dist_dir` and the directories in the `exclude` fields.
  dist_dir: "dist", // Change if needed.
  exclude: ["node_modules", ".git", "build"], // The directories to exclude from the process (e.g. `node_modules`).
  types: ["html", "haml", "css", "js", "ejs", "jsx", "ts", "tsx"], // An empty array means: include all types/formats of files in the build process.
  excluded_types: ["cpp", "cs", "kt"] // use this to exclude types/formats of files that shouldn't be included in the build process.
};
```

### that is it for the brief introduction
you can read more if you want to but this is probably will get you started.

### The `links` field üîó

The `links` field is where you define your links mappings. for example you if got this in your `magiclinks.config.js`:
```js
// magiclinks.config.js
links: {
    $_apple_touch_icon: "assets/images/apple-touch-icon.png",
}
```

and then in your project files:
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="$_apple_touch_icon"> <!-- After the build process this will be replaced with the real link -->
```
```html
<!-- about/index.html -->
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="$_apple_touch_icon"> <!-- After the build process this will be replaced with the real link -->
```

then if you were to change that resource location say to something like `resources/images/apple-touch-icon.png` you only need to change the URL in one place which is in your `links` field and **not in each and every file that ever used or still using that resource**.

or if you are a React guy/girl you will typically have a setup like the following:

```js
// magiclinks.config.js
export default {
  links: {
    $_api_endpoint: "https://api.myapp.com/v1",
    $_auth_endpoint: "https://auth.myapp.com",
    $_assets_cdn: "https://cdn.myapp.com/assets",
    $_avatar_placeholder: "/images/default-avatar.png",
    $_logo_dark: "/branding/logo-dark.svg",
    $_logo_light: "/branding/logo-light.svg"
  },
  src_dirs: [
    "src/components",
    "src/pages",
    "src/layouts",
    "src/features",
    "public"
  ],
  dist_dir: "dist",
  exclude: ["node_modules", ".git", "build", "coverage"],
  types: ["js", "jsx", "ts", "tsx"]
}
```

Then in your React components:

```jsx
// src/components/Header.jsx
function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <img 
        src="$_logo_dark"
        alt="Logo"
        className="dark:hidden"
      />
      <img 
        src="$_logo_light"
        alt="Logo"
        className="hidden dark:block"
      />
    </header>
  )
}

// src/features/auth/api.js
const API_URL = "$_api_endpoint";
const AUTH_URL = "$_auth_endpoint";

export async function login(credentials) {
  const response = await fetch(`${AUTH_URL}/login`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(credentials)
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

After building using the `npx magiclinks` command, all `$_` prefixed strings will be replaced with their actual values, making it easy to change endpoints or asset locations in one place.

**üí° Note:** While Magiclinks works great with any file type, it's particularly powerful in languages that don't have native variables support like HTML, XML, or something similar. but in JavaScript or even CSS you got native variables that could be used to achieve similar results.

**üí° Note:** your not restricted to the `$_` prefix you could really have anything as the key, it just a convention I made to avoid interactions with strings that aren't meant to be related to Magiclinks, but I recommend sticking to it as who knows maybe it will be used in a special way in the future.

### The `src_dirs` field üìÇ

The `src_dirs` field is used to specify the directories to include in the build process, if you didn't specify any directories **the whole project will be read except for the directories specified in the `dist_dir` and the `exclude` fields**.

<br>

### The `dist_dir` field ‚Ü™Ô∏è

The `dist_dir` field is used to specify the output directory.

**üí° Note: Your project structure will be preserved**.

<br>

### The `exclude` field ‚õîÔ∏è

The `exclude` field is used to specify the directories to be excluded from the build process.

**üí° Note: no matter how deep a directory specified in the `exclude` field it will be ***excluded*** for example: say you setup your `magiclinks.config.js` configuration file to be like this:
```js
export default {
  exclude: ["node_modules"],
  // rest of the configuration options...
}
```
and you got `node_modules` at your project's root and another `node_modules` directory deep down your project's tree like `packages/utils/node_modules` both of these directories will be **excluded** because their names appeard at the `exclude` field.

<br>

### The `types` field üìÑ

The `types` field is used to specify the types/formats/extensions of files to be included in the build process.

<br>

### The `excluded_types` field ‚õîÔ∏è

The `excluded_types` field is used to specify types/formats/extensions of files to be excluded from the build process.

## Contribution üåèÔ∏è

**Any contribution is welcome!** really anything will be helpful, especially contributions made to this broken documentation, there is a lot of features that you could implement and a some bugs that you could fix, **so please feel free to contribute :)**.

**üí° Note:** if you could code using **snake_case** instead of **camelCase** it would be really great, thanks!
if I found that people (if any) prefer **camelCase** then will switch to that instead.

## Thanks to free resources out there! üôè

I am a self-taught dev totally learning from free resources, if not for them I wouldn't be to build these things (especially Mozilla developer network and W3Schools), so this is my little gift to the community, hopefully it will be of some benefit :).

### Another thing... üëáÔ∏è

Here is a ready-to-use config file, you could consider it as the "default" config file:
```js
export default {
  links: {}, // Define your links mappings here.
  src_dirs: [], // An empty array means: read the whole project except for the `dist_dir` and the directories in the `exclude` fields.
  dist_dir: "dist", // Change if needed.
  exclude: ["node_modules", ".git", "build"], // The directories to be excluded from the process (e.g. `node_modules`).
  types: ["html", "haml", "css", "js", "ejs", "jsx", "ts", "tsx"], // An empty array means: include all types/formats of files in the build process.
  excluded_types: [] // use this to exclude types/formats of files that shouldn't be included in the build process.
};
```
this ready-to-go file is mostly for absolute juniors out there, as I have been one before and it was really hard navigating my way through huge projects (I am not saying that this is a huge project by any means) and finding the most basic of things, don't underestimate it even such a small thing will help the developers of less experience that are often overlooked.
